## The task at hand:
<p> the task we were giving was to create a multi choice quiz on javascript. </p>

---
## Screenshots and Description:
<p>I started with making the first html page. I used there pages all up. landing page, quiz page and high scores. </p>
First html:

<br>
<p>I think wanted to decide on a colour scheme. My first few examples were pretty bad:</p>
<br>

<p>That final image i then tweeked with a bit and animated the colour gradient for a more interesting look.</p>

<p>Heres and snippet of the gradient background: </p>

<br>
<p>I also added a hover effect for my button. i had alot of fun with the css of this project.</p>

<br>
<p>I did have a bit of trouble with getting the questions to appear on the boxes i made but i got there in the end.</p>

<br>
<p>I also created a start function to reset everything/set up the page: </p>

<p>As you can see I did plan on making a randomise function but scrapped the idea cos I was running out of time.</p>
I believe the timer was the easiest function to make. 
<br>
<p> As you can see on the demo below i have a correct and incorrect animation on the buttons.If incorrect the score/timer goes down by 3.And I also added a progress bar for some flair snippets will be under demo.</p>

<br>
<p>And once the score hits 0 or there is no questions left the submit button and label that is hidden will appear. The score is then saved in local storage. </p>

<p>The user is then taken to the high score screen.</p>

<br>
<p>Unfortunately due to time restraints i couldn't get my function adding local storage to the highscore board to work. but i will come back to this a resubmit!! </p>

## future plans:
<p>I plan to come back to this project and finish it fully i feel like im very close to finishing the final function i also want to disable the quiz buttons when the submit label is up. </p>
<p>Something i learnt from this is to get functionality working before style its easy to get carried away with the world of css if i spent less time on the style i may have completed this on time. </p>
